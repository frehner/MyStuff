This project was one "sprint" of my semester long project.  This sprint is a desktop application that is intended to replicate the administrative side of a point-of-sale system; item, customer, and employee management.  

A couple of the classes were provided for me (and the rest of the class, to ensure that there was a similar base for each student), but all of the functionality and most of the classes were built by me personally.

As part of this project I was also to design a database schema for this project: that database schema relates to each class found in this project.
